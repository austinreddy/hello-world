# hello-world

Salve,

I am trying to figure this stuff out! Learning my tools!!



(7/2/21) Trying to figure out how this github stuff works; trying to teach myself programming so I can start applying to programming jobs to get experience, and/or start working freelance programming jobs, preferably remote ones. That way, I can have enough money to do what I really want: travel, study philosophy, improve my capacities and knowledge and understanding of the world.
